### Distributed Event Handling P2P Spec.
In this specification, an event is a data construct that encompasses both context and content about an occurrence. Each event is distinguished by a unique identifier (ULID) and its context, ensuring traceability and uniqueness across the system.

Unlike traditional event systems where events are merely facts without inherent destinations, this system integrates event routing as a core concept. Here, events are not just recorded occurrences but are also carriers of intent, effectively bridging the gap between event generation and message-oriented middleware.

### Event Handling in Distributed Systems
Events serve as the backbone of server-side interactions, particularly in integrating disparate systems. In this architecture, a state change in one component can trigger functionality in another, unrelated component. Events can be generated in response to various stimuli, such as external signals (HTTP requests, RPC calls) or observed changes (sensor data, user actions).

To illustrate the system's operation, consider a scenario where an event is generated by a source, which is then encapsulated and transmitted via a chosen protocol to its destination. This event triggers an action, which processes the event data, potentially leading to further events or actions.

Sources in this system are uniquely identifiable instances with the ability to generate specific types of events. This specification allows for flexibility in deployment, including various stages such as development, testing, and production. The delivery of events can be facilitated through a variety of protocols, both standard and proprietary.

### Design Goals and Expanded Scope
The primary objective of this specification is to define a framework for event generation, handling, and routing in a distributed system, where components can be developed, deployed, and operated independently.

#### Key Goals Include:
- **Interoperability**: Ensuring that different components of the system can effectively communicate and handle events, regardless of their individual implementations.
- **Event Routing**: Unlike traditional event systems, this specification includes routing as a core aspect, enabling dynamic delivery of events to appropriate destinations.
- **Flexibility**: Allowing for various types of events and sources, catering to a wide range of applications and use cases.

#### Addressing Traditional Non-Goals:
- **Function Invocation**: The specification provides guidance on how events trigger actions or functions, encompassing the invocation process.
- **Runtime APIs**: Offering insights into API design that supports event handling and processing, acknowledging the need for language-specific implementations.
- **Security and Compliance**: Including considerations for authorization, data integrity, and confidentiality within the event handling process.

### Expanded Implementation Considerations
This specification recognizes the importance of protocol-level information, including routing details, as integral to the event's lifecycle. It also acknowledges the value of event persistence, both for operational continuity and for analytical purposes. Therefore, it includes guidelines for implementing these aspects effectively and securely.

The system's design accommodates the addition of security-related attributes and mechanisms, understanding that different implementers might have varying security requirements. While the specification sets the foundation, it allows for extensions and customizations to address specific security and compliance needs.

### Conclusion
This revised specification provides a comprehensive framework for distributed event handling, including aspects traditionally considered beyond the scope of event systems. By addressing a wider range of requirements, it aims to offer a more versatile and robust solution suitable for a variety of complex, distributed applications.

This extended specification, with its implementation guidelines and best practices, provides a robust framework for building systems that can handle complex, event-driven processes in a scalable, secure, and efficient manner. The example use cases illustrate the specification's applicability across different domains, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.

Adding an example for a personal loan finance company, we can illustrate how the "Distributed Event Handling and Resolution Specification" can be utilized to manage complex events and workflows, especially in scenarios where events and business logic are not directly visible to end-users.

## Example Use Case: Personal Loan Finance Company

### Scenario Description
A personal loan finance company processes various types of events related to loan applications, customer queries, payment processing, fraud detection, and more. The events are diverse, including customer interactions, internal process triggers, and financial transactions.

### Implementation with the Specification
1. **Event Generation (REK and ULID Assignment)**:
   - Each customer action, like loan application submission or inquiry, generates an event with a unique ULID.
   - Internal events, such as credit checks or loan approval processes, also generate events with distinct ULIDs.

2. **Event Routing and Actor Interaction**:
   - Events are routed to appropriate actors based on their type and context. For example, loan applications are routed to loan processing actors, while customer inquiries are directed to customer service actors.
   - The system ensures that the actors (automated systems or employees) have the relevant context and state information to process the event.

3. **Data Mesh/Domain Governance (DM/DG)**:
   - Data governance policies ensure that sensitive financial data is handled securely and in compliance with regulations.
   - Access to data is strictly controlled and monitored.

4. **Protocol Integration**:
   - The system integrates with various protocols for different types of events. For instance, HTTP/HTTPS for web-based customer interactions, secure messaging protocols for internal communications, and financial transaction protocols for payments and credit checks.

### Complex Event and Workflow Handling
- **Workflow for Loan Application**:
  - A customer submits a loan application online (Event Generated).
  - The application is assigned a ULID and routed to a credit check actor (Automated System).
  - Simultaneously, an event is sent to a fraud detection actor to analyze the application for potential fraud.
  - Based on the credit check and fraud analysis, the application is either approved, requiring further documentation (generating additional events), or rejected.

- **Handling Customer Queries**:
  - Customer queries generate events that are routed to customer service actors.
  - These actors have access to the customer's history and context (via State Context and ULID) to provide personalized and efficient responses.

- **Payment Processing**:
  - Payment events are generated when customers make repayments.
  - These events go through security checks and are processed by payment actors.
  - Notifications of successful payments are then sent back to the customers, and the loan balance is updated accordingly.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Automated event handling speeds up processes like loan applications and customer queries.
- **Scalability**: The system can handle a high volume of events simultaneously without performance degradation.
- **Security and Compliance**: Robust data governance and adherence to financial regulations.
- **Traceability**: ULID provides a means to trace and audit the entire lifecycle of each event.

In this use case, the "Distributed Event Handling and Resolution Specification" enables the finance company to manage complex events and workflows efficiently and securely. By leveraging this specification, the company can enhance its operational efficiency, ensure compliance with financial regulations, and provide better customer service.

To create a simple proof of concept (PoC) for the personal loan finance company scenario using the "Distributed Event Handling and Resolution Specification," we'll outline a basic implementation focusing on a key aspect of the process, such as loan application processing. This PoC will demonstrate how events are generated, managed, and processed in a simplified workflow.

### PoC Objective
Demonstrate the handling of loan application events from submission to initial processing, including event generation, routing, and actor interaction.

### Components
1. **Event Generator**: Simulates customer actions such as submitting loan applications.
2. **ULID Assigner**: Assigns a unique ULID to each event for tracking and categorization.
3. **Event Router**: Routes events to the appropriate actors based on predefined rules.
4. **Actors**:
   - **Credit Check Actor**: Automated system for performing credit checks.
   - **Fraud Detection Actor**: System for detecting potential fraudulent applications.

### Workflow
1. **Loan Application Submission**:
   - A customer submits a loan application through a simulated interface.
   - The Event Generator creates an event with details like customer ID, loan amount, and submission timestamp.

2. **ULID Assignment**:
   - The ULID Assigner assigns a unique ULID to the event, ensuring its traceability.

3. **Event Routing**:
   - The Event Router receives the event and determines the next steps based on its type.
   - The event is routed to both the Credit Check Actor and the Fraud Detection Actor.

4. **Credit Check and Fraud Detection**:
   - The Credit Check Actor performs a credit analysis based on the customer's data and returns a result (e.g., pass/fail, credit score).
   - The Fraud Detection Actor analyzes the application for potential fraud indicators and returns a risk assessment.

5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - A simple aggregator collects results from both actors.
   - If both checks are passed, the application proceeds to the next stage (e.g., documentation); otherwise, it's flagged for review or rejection.

### Implementation Technologies (Hypothetical)
- **Event Generator**: A simple web form or API endpoint.
- **ULID Assigner**: A lightweight service or library generating ULIDs.
- **Event Router**: A rule-based routing system, possibly using a message broker or a custom script.
- **Actors**: Simulated services or scripts representing the credit check and fraud detection processes.

### Running the PoC
- Start all components (Event Generator, ULID Assigner, Event Router, Actors).
- Submit a loan application using the Event Generator.
- Observe how the event is processed through the system, with logging to demonstrate the flow and results.

### Expected Outcome
The PoC should successfully demonstrate the end-to-end process of event generation, routing, and processing within the specified framework. The key focus is on showing how different components interact and how the ULID aids in tracking and managing events.
